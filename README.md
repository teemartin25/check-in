## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.


## Future improvements:

Might change how the status indicator looks like. Will make it a bit small for better user experience.

## FAQs

Q: How can I upload an image file and set it as a profile photo? 
A: Unfortunately, the app do not have that capability yet (will be added soon) But you can for the meantime use the image path / URL so we can show everyone your beautiful faces!
